            <p>Hunter Searches for answers for problems so vast that normal computer search methods canâ€™t find
              an solution in a reasonable time - or maybe ever.</p>
            <p>
              A few examples:
            <ul>
              <li> Medical: A better material replacement for knee cartiledge. This involves areas of Material
                Science (Physics), BioChemical, BioMedical, and others. Computers might try to assemble atoms 
                and molecules for a material safe amongst the 300 types of cells
                in the human body yet has all the characteristics for elasticity, hardness, etc. needed.</li>
              <li> Other BioMedical research areas such as Stem Cell Research, Cancer, or Viruses. </li>
              <li> Many problems are multi-part: first you must find a physical structure, for example, and
                then find a way to manufacture it.  Hunter's "State-Machine Techniques" work  
                on finding suitable materials while allowing Hunter to also look for ways to approach 
                creating them.
              </li>
              <li> Additional areas of clinical research range from the common cold, flu, HIV, heart disease, and 
                Parkinson's and degenerative aging.
              </li>
              <li> Long-term Weather prediction. A lot of work has gone into improving weather
                prediction over the years, it still has room for a lot of improvement.
              </li>
              <li> Improving crop production inspite of "natural" influences.</li>
              <li> Creating educational applications that adapt to the abilities and 
                characteristics of the student.
              </li>
            </ul>
