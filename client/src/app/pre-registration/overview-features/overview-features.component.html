          <p>Solution Hunter has advanced Genetic Algorithms methods to allow this type of search engine 
            to be even faster and more effective.
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using Hunter requires that it "understand" the type of problem as well as having
              a list of the things that influence it.  It generally divides problems into "static"
              or "pattern" types.  
            </li>
            <li>Hunter provides a number of "plug-ins" targeted for different problem areas.
            </li>
            <li>Hunter can be used by large or small businesses, or individuals.</li>
            <li>It can run on a variety of systems Azure, AWS, or corporate Systems and
              is being configured for packaging in "containers" allowing it to run on 
              Windows, Linux, and others.
            </li>
            <li>It can run on single computers or multiple local or remote systems for additional
            speed. </li>
            <li>	Hunter is highly configurable and can learn to improve its strategy
                to solve the current problem  more efficiently.
                When it finds a better “hunter”, it will dynamically switch to the more powerful image without interruption.
