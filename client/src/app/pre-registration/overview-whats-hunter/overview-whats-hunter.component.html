          <p>Hunter Searches for answers to difficult problems - problems so vast that normal computer methods
            canâ€™t find a solution in a reasonable time.

          <p>The Traveling Salesman problem is a well-known example. The salesperson is to
            visit each of 15 cities and stop at each city only one time; find the shortest route.
            Solution Hunter uses 12 - 15 cities in testing. With traditional searching, this
            involves about 1.6 Trillion combinations and can take super computers centuries to resolve
            without more advanced methods like AI/Genetic Algorithms.</p>

          <p>Historically, the approach to solve harder problems had been to use computers working together
            for days, weeks, months, or even years. Not only expensive, it often didn't produce results 
            in the time needed.</p>

          <p>Hunter would like to get you that answer "real soon now." And it can because it has been designed
            with advanced computing methods along with leading-edge enhancements to "Genetic
            Algorithms."</p>
